<h1>Pac-Man</h1>
---
<p>This is a Pac-Man clone coded completely in java, it has sound included too (so turn your volume up!). Use the arrowkeys to move Pac-Man around, avoid the ghosts, and collect points. There are counters for lives, level, and score in the top left of the screen. Intentional delays have been included at the start and end of the game to let their respective jingles play and to closely mimic the original Pac-Man game.</p>
<br/>
<p>Do note that the arrowkeys do depend on timing a littlebit, as they are coded with the keyReleased() method, so you might have to click multiple times when Pac-Man is at certain openings in the wall to have him go through (I find spamming the arrow when close to the opening works best) (this happens in one block openings in corridors, corners and changing to the opposite direction don't have this happen) <strong>just note that this is intentional to make the game more challenging and intense</strong></p>
